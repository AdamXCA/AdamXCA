This is a very common and important question. The "Print to PDF" and "Download .txt" buttons work because they are client-side (they run only in the user's browser).

Sending an email automatically is a server-side action. For security reasons, a browser (running your HTML/JS) cannot directly send an email. It would be a huge spam risk.

To make this work, you need a backend component. Here are your options, from simplest to most professional.

Option 1: The "No-Backend" Method (Using a Form Service)
This is the easiest way to get started and the one I recommend for a simple HTML file.

Sign up for a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms (if you host on Netlify).

Change your <form> tag:

You will change <form id="careerQuizForm"> to:

<form id="careerQuizForm" action="YOUR_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT_URL" method="POST">

How it works: When the user clicks "Submit," the form data (all the answers, name, and email) is sent to Formspree's server instead of just staying in the browser.

Auto-Email: Formspree will then automatically send you (the admin) an email with all the form data. You can also set up an "Auto-response" email to be sent directly to the user's email address.

Limitation: This method will send the text of the results, but not a dynamically generated PDF. The user still has to use the "Print to PDF" button for that.

Option 2: The "Real Backend" Method (Custom Code)
This is the professional, but complex, way to send a custom PDF automatically.

Backend Server: You set up a simple backend server (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or a Google Cloud Function).

Form Action: Your HTML form submits its data to your server's API endpoint.

Server Receives Data: Your server gets the JSON data of all the answers.

Generate PDF: Your server uses a library (like pdf-lib or puppeteer) to dynamically create a PDF file on the server, populating it with the user's results.

Email Service: Your server connects to an email service API (like SendGrid or Mailgun).

Send Email: Your server tells SendGrid to send an email to the user's email address, attaching the PDF it just created.
